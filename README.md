# Beta Channel README

Readme that you would probably like to read is [here](https://github.com/arterialist/core_messenger/blob/master/README.md).

**WARNING:** Beta channel sometimes contains code that can either work bad or not work at all. This branch is for ones who want to test something that I'm currently working on.

## Current Task

- Drafts for dialogs

## Planned/In Development already

- Switch between Enter/Ctrl+Enter shortcut for sending message
- Notifications (lot of work here)
- Database encryption
- Theming support (lots of things should be changed)

**Issues for beta version are not accepted!**
